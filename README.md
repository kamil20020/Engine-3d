# Engine-3d

I've worked for fun on a very simple graphics engine. I did it to learn more about Java without frameworks and train writing algorithms. I've tried
to implement everything on my own e.g. understand math and algorithms and in case of problems rely on external resources but in limits. Because
of this, most of the algorithms and used structures havebad efficiency. The main reason is that, I most of the computation is done by CPU
and only drawing pixels is done by external tools e.g. OpenGL.

Unfortunatelly algorithms written are so inefficient that I decided to focus on OpenGL with GPU instead of CPU.

## Technologies:
- Java,
	- Swing, AWT (not efficient screen and drawing pixels),
	- Glfw, OpenGL (efficient screen and drawing pixels).
- Maven.

## Completed:
* Drawing basic structures both filled and not:
	* Line,
	* Triangle,
	* Circle,
	* Disk,
	* Rectangle.
* Drawing meshes:
	* Meshes of triangles,
	* Cube.
* Loading and writting models to obj file,
* Textures of meshes,
* Camera,
* Perspective.
